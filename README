Portable home overlay

Just a little script that manages mounting/unmounting a portable overlay off a removable drive.

To install copy this repo to the drive and run ./initph.sh $USER $DEVICE
	eg: ./initph.sh john /dev/sdc1

It will create ~/.phome in john's home directory and populate it with a basic config and mountpoints.
It will also install phome to /usr/local/bin
